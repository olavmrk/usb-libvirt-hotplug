#
# This is a bit ugly. udev passes us the USB bus number and
# device number with leading zeroes. E.g.:
#   BUSNUM=001 DEVNUM=022
# This causes libvirt to assume that the numbers are octal.
# To work around this, we need to strip the leading zeroes.
# The easiest way is to ask bash to convert the numbers from
# base 10:
#
BUSNUM=$((10#$BUSNUM))
DEVNUM=$((10#$DEVNUM))

#
# Now we have all the information we need to update the VM.
# Run the appropriate virsh-command, and ask it to read the
# update XML from stdin.
